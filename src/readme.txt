CISSCAL 4.0 README
------------------

CISSCAL is the Cassini ISS image calibration software package. For more
information, including detailed setup instructions, please see Section 4.4
of the ISS Data User's Guide, available in the document/ directory of the
ISS Calibration Volume (COISS_0011 version 4.2) or at the following URL:

https://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/documentation/iss_data_user_guide_180916.pdf

Additionally, see make_polar_image_readme.txt for information regarding 
polarization calibration using the standalone code make_polar_image.pro. 

Note that when downloaded from the PDS, the CISSCAL software will be found in
the extras/cisscal/ directory, and the calibration support files will be
found in the calib/ directory.

CISSCAL is written in Interactive Data Language (IDL), and must be run on a
computer on which IDL has been installed. As of this writing, CISSCAL has 
been tested for compatibility with IDL versions 5.5 through 8.2. In addition, 
the following system variables must be set (typically in user's .cshrc file 
or equivalent) for CISSCAL to work properly:

- CisscalDir, directory containing CISSCAL code, e.g.
   setenv CisscalDir /home/username/cisscal

- CalibrationBaseDir, directory containing calibration support files, e.g.
   setenv CalibrationBaseDir /home/username/calib

- ImageBaseDir, default image directory, e.g.
   setenv ImageBaseDir /home/username/images

The default calibration options can be set by the user by editing the text
file cisscal_default_options.txt, located in the CisscalDir defined above.

CISSCAL was developed in stages, beginning in August 1998, under the auspices
of the Cassini Imaging Central Laboratory for Operations (CICLOPS) directed
by Dr. Carolyn Porco, ISS Team Leader. The theoretical basis and pipeline
design for Cassini image calibration was developed by ISS team member Dr.
Robert West of JPL. The systems design for the CISSCAL software, and its
original implementation and development, was the work of Dr. Kevin Beurle at
Queen Mary, University of London from August 1998 through March 2002.
Beginning in April 2002, major design and algorithmic modifications, software
additions, debugging and maintenance have been performed by Ben Knowles of
CICLOPS/Space Science Institute, Boulder, CO under the direct supervision of
West.  Significant contributions (algorithms, software, evaluation and
validation, etc.) have been made by West, Vance Haemmerle of JPL (while at
CICLOPS), Daren Wilson of CICLOPS, and other members of the Cassini ISS Team.
