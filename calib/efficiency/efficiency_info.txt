Efficiency directory:
---------------------

This directory contains various files necessary for calculating the 
transmission of the ISS cameras as a function of wavelength:

 ccdqe.tab - CCD quantum efficiencies for NAC and WAC.
 na_optics.tab and wa_optics.tab - Optics transmission functions.
 solarflux.tab - Solar spectrum.
 omega0.tab - Omega_0 (total sensitivity) factors for common filter 
  combinations.

The systrans directory contains the non-wavelength-integrated system 
transmission values (QE*optics*filter1*filter2) for each filter combination. 
The naming convention for these files is as follows:

<camera><filter 1><filter 2>_systrans.tab

where <camera> is "issna" or "isswa," and <filter 1> and <filter 2> represent
the filter names. For polarized filter combinations, values are given for the
parallel orientation of the filter (full transmission), with values for the 
perpendicular (blocking) orientation provided in files with subscript 
"_b_systrans.tab". 

Columns in systrans files are as follows:

 1st column: Wavelength (nm)  
 2nd column: Transmitted Flux
 3rd column: Transmitted Flux * Solar Flux (phot per cm^2-s-angstrom at 1 AU)

This directory also includes the files na_effwl.tab and wa_effwl.tab, which
give the central and effective wavelengths of each filter combination as well 
as their FWHM in nm.
