Correction Directory:
---------------------

The files nac_qe_correction.tab and wac_qe_correction.tab contain a 
normalized wavelength-dependent correction function to be applied to the 
quantum efficiencies of the NAC and WAC during absolute calibration. 

The file correctionfactors_qecorr.tab contains filter-specific absolute 
radiometric correction factors to be applied to each filter combination 
individually, and properly takes into account the quantum efficiency 
correction described above. These corrections were derived from in-flight
photometric analysis of standard stars, along with Enceladus, Rhea, Dione,
Titan, Jupiter and Saturn. Details of this analysis can be found in the
ISS Data User's Guide, and [WESTETAL2010].
