Antibloom directory:
--------------------

The files abpair_mask_ground_nac.img and abpair_mask_ground_wac.img
are VICAR-format image files containing masks of the anti-blooming
mode pixel pairs in the NAC and WAC, as seen in ground calibration
data. However, since these pixel pairs seem to change with time, these
files are not used by CISSCAL; instead, an A/B pixel pair identification 
algorithm is used that is not reliant on a specific mask file.
