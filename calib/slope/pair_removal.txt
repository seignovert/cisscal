This set of slope files was derived from long exposure Thermal/Vac
images with Anti-blooming ON. This resulted in the formation of 
the bright-dark pixel pairs of various degrees of intensity.  In 
order to use these slope files to correct Anti-blooming OFF data 
or data with short exposures, the pairs had to be removed.

The pair-removal process involved:
1. Determination of which slope files needed fixed
   - This was a visual inspection process
2. Determination of a criteria for which pairs to remove
   - Trial and error gave a useful threshhold of
     (pair delta DN >= 5% of mean DN)
3. Generation of a procedure to remove the pairs
   - A VICAR procedure was generated (see description below)
4. Validation that nothing bad happened to the good data
   - Visual inspection of the corrected files and differencing
     vs. the original files
     
Removal Procedure
The slope file generation process begins with raw flat-field data.
These data files are then summed by exposure level before being
processed into slope files.  Due to software limitations, it was 
determined that the removal process had to act upon the summed
input data.

The summed files were corrected in the following way:
1. A filter was applied to identify each pixel which had the
   characteristic of a large positive difference between itself
   and its neighbor above.
2. Areas of known natural large differences not due to pairs
   were then excluded.
3. The remaining pairs were replaced by the median value of the
   surrounding pixels
   
The corrected sums were then processed with the original slope
file generation process.  The current set was generated on Unix,
so the floating point numbers may differ insignificantly from 
the old files produced on the VMS OS in the 1990's.
